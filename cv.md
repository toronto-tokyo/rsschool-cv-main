## About myself
---
I am impressed by the values and principles: confidence, reliability, professionalism, trust, maintaining an atmosphere of comfort, friendliness and mutual assistance. I believe that this approach guarantees success.


At the moment I have no experience in IT, however, if you need a specialist who is motivated to achieve results in work, ready to contribute to the prosperity of the company, I will be happy to become part of your team. I am sure that by gaining experience, I will be able to become an experienced employee who can benefit the company.
